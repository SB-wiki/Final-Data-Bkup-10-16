# Add-a-course-as-a-resource-in-the-course-editor

### Background

As a content creator, when creating a course I should be able to add another course

### Solution:-

#### Enabled root node with add child node & add a resource option

_Config:-_

```
"nodeDisplayCriteria": {
		"contentType": [ "Course", "CourseUnit",
			"Collection"
		]
	}, 
```

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_from\_2020\_05\_23\_13\_36\_34 (1).png>)

* By clicking on the root node(three dots) - Add “New Child“ and “Add Resource“ will show
* By selecting on the root node meta form should not show for the root node

#### Resource Browser

* By clicking on the add resource “Latest course“ section will show along with the other resource sections
* After adding the “Course” in the root node the courseUnit/resource/collection of that course will show in the preview section

* The new child and new sibling on the selection of any published course/resource/collection will be disabled.

#### Resource browser filter

* As per the “Resource-framework“ config, the resource filter form will show
* This resource filter form will depend on the subtype (Textbook, Course, Collection).
* If the board is available for this “resource-framework“ the board filter will show
* By default, the board dropdown will be selected as per the context config
* The contentType “Course“ will be shown in the “ContenType“ dropdown.

```
window.context = {
  "user": {
    ...
  },
  "framework": "TPD",
  "resource_framework": "NCFCOPY",
  "env": "course",
  "board": [
    "CBSE"
  ]
}
```
